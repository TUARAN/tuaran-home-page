# Ruan Yifeng Weekly Style

## Purpose

Use this skill to draft or revise Chinese technology newsletter content with the recognizable feel of 阮一峰《科技爱好者周刊》: calm, direct, explanatory, curated, and practical.

Do not imitate personal identity, claim authorship by 阮一峰, or copy source sentences. Treat this as a style guide for original writing.

## Core Voice

- Write in modern written Chinese, close to spoken explanation but not colloquial chat.
- Prefer short declarative sentences. One sentence usually carries one idea.
- Keep the tone calm, factual, and lightly opinionated. Avoid hype, slogans, dense rhetoric, and emotional adjectives.
- Explain technical topics as if the reader is a curious programmer, not a specialist in that exact field.
- Use concrete facts, examples, dates, product names, company names, numbers, and simple comparisons.
- Make judgments in plain language: “这说明……”“原因是……”“结果就是……”“更好的做法是……”
- Keep the authorial presence modest. “我认为”“我发现”“我的看法是” can appear, but do not dominate.

## Structure Patterns

For a full weekly-style article, use this order when appropriate:

1. Opening line: “这里记录每周值得分享的科技内容，周五发布。”
2. Brief housekeeping: open source, submissions, hiring, contact, or sponsorship if relevant.
3. Cover image note: one short factual caption.
4. Main topic essay: a clear title, then 5-12 numbered sections.
5. Sponsored activity or announcement: practical, concrete, restrained.
6. Curated sections: “文章”“工具”“AI 相关”“资源”“图片”“文摘”“言论”“往年回顾”.
7. Closing marker: “（完）” when a complete issue is requested.

For a single essay, use:

1. Short title.
2. A setup paragraph that names the event, question, or observed phenomenon.
3. Numbered points, each with a compact subheading.
4. A final practical conclusion, not a grand ending.

## Main Essay Technique

- Start from a concrete event, report, visit, product, paper, or public discussion.
- State why it matters in simple terms before giving analysis.
- Break the topic into numbered observations.
- Give each numbered observation a short noun phrase title, such as “1、算力的差距” or “3、计算效率”.
- Within each point, use 2-5 short paragraphs.
- Move from facts to explanation to implication.
- Prefer causal connectors: “原因是”“但是”“结果就是”“这使得”“还有另一个因素”.
- Use contrast often: China vs. US, old vs. new, theory vs. reality, SaaS vs. cloud, training vs. inference.
- When summarizing outside sources, say that you selected and organized the material for readability.

## Curated Item Technique

For link recommendations, use a compact numbered format:

```markdown
1、项目名或文章名

一句话说明它是什么。

再用一两句话解释它有什么用，或者为什么值得看。
```

Rules:

- The item title should be concrete, usually a tool, article, dataset, repository, or resource name.
- The first sentence answers “这是什么”.
- The second sentence answers “为什么有用 / 有趣 / 值得注意”.
- Mention language or platform only when useful: “英文”“Mac 系统”“命令行工具”“开源”.
- For reader submissions, append attribution only if supplied: “（@name 投稿）”.

## Sentence And Paragraph Habits

- Keep paragraphs short: usually 1-3 sentences.
- Use many standalone explanatory sentences.
- Use simple punctuation. Chinese comma and full stop are enough most of the time.
- Prefer Arabic numerals for data and numbered lists.
- Put parenthetical clarification after the term: “AGI（通用人工智能）”.
- Use “比如”“参见”“可以参考”“另可参考” for examples and related links.
- Avoid long metaphors, ornate transitions, and literary openings.
- Avoid marketing words unless the source is an ad section; even there, keep it practical.

## Opinion Style

- Make opinions concrete and testable.
- Avoid absolute claims unless the evidence is strong.
- Prefer phrases like:
  - “这种看法只适用于……”
  - “目前看来，趋势更像是……”
  - “这既是一种选择，也是一种无奈。”
  - “我的判断是……”
  - “这跟……形成鲜明对比。”
- End with a useful takeaway, not a flourish.

## Editing Checklist

Before finalizing:

- Is the topic explained from first principles enough for a general tech reader?
- Are paragraphs short and skimmable?
- Are claims backed by concrete details or framed as opinion?
- Is the structure visible through numbered sections and plain subheadings?
- Did you remove hype, dense jargon, and decorative prose?
- If imitating the weekly format, are curated sections concise and useful?
- Does the final text feel like an original article in this style, not a copied article?

## Mini Example

Input note: “A new open source database compresses logs better than Elasticsearch.”

Output style:

```markdown
1、一个日志数据库

最近，一个开源日志数据库受到关注。

它的特点是，把日志先转成列式存储，再做压缩。这样一来，同样的机器可以保存更多日志，查询成本也会下降。

这类项目说明，日志系统正在从“能搜到”转向“搜得起”。对于中小团队，后者可能更重要。
